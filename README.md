# ACollectionOfPythonCode
This repository contains a collection of Python files that I wrote during my early days of #100DaysOfCode. In it are some codes on basic python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and solutions to some several HackerRank challenges. The code is sparsely commented but I'll do a better job in future code.

Cheers,
Kenneth Murerwa
